// Mock AI Mentor Questions & Answers
export const mockMentorQA = [
  { 
    question: "How do I find my first customers?", 
    answer: "Start with your network and early adopters who understand your vision. Identify communities where your target users gather, both online and offline. Offer a compelling incentive for early users such as free access, discounts, or added services. Focus on delivering exceptional value to these first users to generate word-of-mouth referrals." 
  },
  { 
    question: "When should I hire my first employee?", 
    answer: "Hire your first employee when you consistently cannot handle the workload, and it's limiting growth. Look for skills complementary to yours that address critical business needs. Consider starting with contractors or part-time help before full-time hires. The right timing is usually when the cost of the hire is outweighed by the revenue or time they'll generate." 
  },
  { 
    question: "How much equity should I give early employees?", 
    answer: "Early employees typically receive 0.5-2% equity, depending on their role, experience, and stage of your startup. Use a vesting schedule (typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff) to protect everyone's interests. Consider the total dilution across your team, advisors, and future funding rounds. The key is balancing meaningful ownership that motivates employees while preserving enough equity for future growth." 
  },
  { 
    question: "What metrics should I focus on initially?", 
    answer: "Focus on metrics that directly reflect product-market fit and customer value: user engagement (daily/weekly active users), retention rates, conversion rate (from free to paid), customer acquisition cost (CAC), and customer lifetime value (LTV). Avoid vanity metrics that don't translate to business health. Pick 3-5 key metrics that align with your specific business model and growth stage."
